# Water Under Pressure — ATELIA × ESCP Starter Kit

> This repo is your starting point. Codex should read this README first.

## How to Get Started

This repo is a **template**: click **Fork** (top right), not "Use this template." Fork keeps your copy linked back to the original — that's what lets ATELIA automatically find every team's work, without anyone needing to send a link.

Once you've forked it, add your teammates as collaborators (Settings → Collaborators on your fork), and leave the visibility as **Public** — don't switch it to Private, or we lose access to your work.

## The Brief

The full brief is in `WATER_Case_Brief.md`. Unlike the other case, there's no single company or fixed decision here — you choose the angle. The list of real, free public data sources you can build on is in `data/PUBLIC_SOURCES.md`.

One-sentence summary: Europe's water stress became a visible economic story in 2026 — droughts, record-low rivers, industrial shutdown risk, and a wave of EU investment. Your job is to pick a real problem inside that story and build a tool that helps someone make a better decision about it, using real public data.

## Rule #1 — Prompt Logging Is Automatic

This repo includes an `AGENTS.md` file, which Codex reads automatically at the start of every task — you don't need to open or edit it. The first time you talk to Codex in a new conversation, it will ask for your **student ID**. Answer it, and from then on Codex logs every prompt you send it — automatically, verbatim — into `prompts/<your-id>/session-*.md`, without you doing anything else.

**You don't fill this in by hand.** Your only job is to make sure that log file gets committed along with your code changes — Codex writes it, but you still need to include it when your pull request is created and merged. If a pull request only has code changes and no updated log file, that's a sign something didn't get logged.

Why we're doing this: it's not to monitor you. It's what lets us understand, at the end, how you reasoned — not just what you produced. A good result reached with a clear prompt from the start isn't scored the same as a good result reached after fifteen random attempts.

## Rule #2 — Before You Code, Ask Yourself These Questions

Check each box in this README as you go — not at the end, while you're working:

- [ ] **Data**: what data does your tool actually pull, and from where? If you're using a live public API, is any of it rate-limited or does it require an API key?
- [ ] **API keys**: if a source requires a free API key (a couple in `data/PUBLIC_SOURCES.md` do), where is it stored? Never hardcoded in a file committed to GitHub. (A valid answer: "we only used sources that don't require a key.")
- [ ] **Deployment**: if you deployed a live demo, does any endpoint expose your API key, or return unfiltered raw data to any visitor?
- [ ] **Attribution**: are you using real public data appropriately — no claim that estimated or invented numbers are official figures?
- [ ] **Storage**: if you downloaded a snapshot of a dataset instead of calling it live, did you commit it to the repo? If so, is it small enough to be reasonable, and is its source clearly documented?
- [ ] **Robustness**: what happens if the user gives an empty, inconsistent, or unexpected input? What happens if the external data source is temporarily down?
- [ ] **Explainability**: can you explain to someone non-technical why your tool does what it does, and which real data it's actually built on?
- [ ] **Business relevance**: does your prototype solve a real, specific problem for a real kind of user — or is it an interesting technical build with no clear "who is this for"?

These questions aren't here to slow you down — they're part of what's being evaluated. A thoughtful answer to one of them is worth more than an extra feature nobody asked for.

## What We Expect at the End

- A prototype that works, even partially, using at least one real public data source
- Your prompt log (`prompts/<your-id>/session-*.md`) committed and up to date
- A short paragraph below, written in business language (not technical), explaining what you built, for whom, and why
- A live URL (Vercel or similar) if you deployed it — not required to still get credit, but expected if you did

## Our Approach

*[To be filled in by the team at the end.]*

## Vercel deployment

The pricing engine is exposed as a Vercel serverless function at `/api/`.
Deploy from the repository root with the Vercel CLI or by importing the repository into Vercel. A `GET /api/` health check returns service status; send pricing inputs as JSON to `POST /api/`. Optional multiplier assumptions can be supplied in a `config` object, matching `PricingConfig` in `pricing_engine.py`.

## Scenario comparison

Send `mode: "scenario_comparison"` to `POST /api/` with representative
`household` and `company` inputs plus at least three `scenarios`. A scenario
overrides shared inputs such as `name` and `scarcity_score`. The response
contains side-by-side household/company prices, pollution surcharge per m³,
expected bills, total revenue, revenue gap versus the optional
`desired_total_annual_revenue`, and `binding_constraints` (price floors,
ceilings, or revenue-target status).

The `charts.scarcity_curve` response contains 21 points from scarcity 0 to 1
for plotting household price, company price, and total utility revenue.
# Water pricing engine

The MVP treats water quality as a treatment requirement, not as a direct
proxy for price. Callers provide `treatment_intensity_score` from 0 (no
additional treatment) to 1 (highest treatment requirement for the intended
use). The calculation is deliberately transparent:

`price = clamp(base × scarcity × consumption × pollution + treatment_intensity_score × treatment_cost_per_intensity_m3)`

`treatment_cost_per_intensity_m3` is configurable in `PricingConfig` (default
€0.40/m³ at intensity 1). Results include the numeric contribution and the
display-ready explanation: “Treatment requirement contributed +€X/m³ to this
scenario.” This is a prototype score, not an engineering estimate.

## Public scarcity data

`GET /api/?geography=Germany` retrieves the EEA country-level WEI+ CSV. The response keeps the raw WEI+ percentage, source, year, and transformation visible alongside the prototype's separately calculated scarcity score. The score is `min(max(raw WEI+ %, 0), 40) / 40`; this is a prototype normalization, not an official EEA or EU metric. The API returns a clear error when the selected geography is unavailable.

The EEA WEI+ country series was selected because it is a direct, no-auth download with annual country values. The European Drought Observatory remains useful for current drought monitoring, but its indicator layers require more spatial and temporal processing than this prototype needs.
